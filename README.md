# AIS
A bunch of miscellaneous scritps I used during my work with AIS data.
For more information about the nearestGLB script please refer to this [post on crossvalidated] (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/161379/quickly-finding-nearest-time-observation). I have just copied the code into an R script.
